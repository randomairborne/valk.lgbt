subdomain host and link shortener. Links change.

- [search6](https://search6.valk.sh/) ([repo](https://github.com/randomairborne/search6)) \
a way to search the minecraft discord levels. it does a *ton* of other stuff too, but most of it isn't for the public to use.

- [experienced](https://xp.valk.sh/) ([repo](https://github.com/randomairborne/experienced)) \
experienced and minixpd are two discord bots that share a ton of code, one self-hostable, the other hosted
by me, to make discord leveling easy and open.

- [giveip](https://giveip.io) ([repo](https://github.com/randomairborne/giveip)) \
giveip is a no-logs, free-to-use, no-frills IP address echoer. v4.giveip.io and v6.giveip.io will return only
for that type of IP address. /raw on any endpoint will return the IP as plaintext, with a trailing newline.

- [mcping](https://mcping.me) ([repo](https://github.com/randomairborne/mcping)) \
mcping pings Java and Bedrock minecraft servers.

firefox.best is a website i made to make people want to use firefox.

- [newtodiscord](https://newtodiscord.com) ([repo](https://github.com/randomairborne/newtodiscord)) \
newtodiscord is for people who are new to discord, and don't really know how it works.
