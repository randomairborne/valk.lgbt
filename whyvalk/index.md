# Why are you called valkyrie?

TL;DR cool airplane

My name comes from the [North American XB-70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_XB-70_Valkyrie).
It does not come from Norse mythology, Clash of Clans, or Overwatch.

In addition, please do not call me val (that's a different person) or valky (ew.)
